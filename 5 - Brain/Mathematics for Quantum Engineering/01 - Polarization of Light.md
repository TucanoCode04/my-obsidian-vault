# Polarization of Light
Polarization of light refers to the orientation of the oscillations of the electric field vector in an electromagnetic wave. In unpolarized light, the electric field vectors vibrate in multiple planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In contrast, polarized light has electric field vectors that vibrate predominantly in a single plane.
