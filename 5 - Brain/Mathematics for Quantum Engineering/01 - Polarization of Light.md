# Polarization of Light
An electromagnetic wave consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. For example, a wave traveling in the z-direction has its electric field oscillating up and down on the x-axis and its magnetic field oscillating side to side on the y-axis.
Polarization of light refers to the orientation of the oscillations of the electric field vector in an electromagnetic wave. In unpolarized light, the electric field vectors vibrate in multiple planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In contrast, polarized light has electric field vectors that vibrate predominantly in a single plane.

Considering an electromagnetic wave traveling in the z-direction, the electric field can be represented as:
