##### What is the difference between quantum correlation and classical correlation?
A classical correlation can always be explained by shared information, common causes, or pre-existing conditions. The values of the measurements are determined by local hidden variables. They exist independently of observation.
Classical correlations can be understood through classical probability theory and do not exhibit any non-local behavior. In particular, they do not violate Bell's inequalities. We can simply describe classical correlations using joint probability distributions:
$$P(A, B) = P(A) P(B | A)$$
where $A$ and $B$ are classical random variables.
