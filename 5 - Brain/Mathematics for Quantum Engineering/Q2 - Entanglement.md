##### What is the difference between quantum correlation and classical correlation?
A classical correlation can always be explained by shared information, common causes, or pre-existing conditions. The values of the measurements are determined by local hidden variables. They exist independently of observation.
Classical correlations can be understood through classical probability theory and do not exhibit any non-local behavior. In particular, they do not violate Bell's inequalities. We can simply describe classical correlations using joint probability distributions:
$$P(A, B) = P(A) P(B | A)$$
where $A$ and $B$ are classical random variables.
Quantum correlations, on the other hand, arise from the principles of quantum mechanics and can exhibit non-local behavior that cannot be explained by classical means. They are a result of the superposition principle and the entanglement of quantum states. Quantum correlations can violate Bell's inequalities, demonstrating that no local hidden variable theory can fully explain them.
Quantum correlations are described using the formalism of quantum mechanics, particularly the density matrix or wavefunction. For two entangled particles, the joint state cannot be factored into individual states:
$$|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle_A |1\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A |0\rangle_B)$$
where $|\psi\rangle$ is an entangled state of particles A and B.

##### Write the state $|GHZ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|000\rangle + |111\rangle)$ in the basis:
- $|+\rangle, |-\rangle$
- 
Can you write the state|GHZ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|000\rangle + |111\rangle) in the basis:

|+\rangle, |-\rangle and
