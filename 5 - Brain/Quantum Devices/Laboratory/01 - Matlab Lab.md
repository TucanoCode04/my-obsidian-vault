We aim to solve numerically the 1D steady-state Schrödinger equation in quantum wells with finite depth.
In this numerical analysis we remove some of the approximation made in the analytical solution. 
From mathematical standpoint, we are solving a second order partial differential equation, complex valued.
$$\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + U(x)\right]\psi(x) = E\psi(x)$$
##### Rectangular Quantum Well
We consider a rectangular quantum well of width of height $U(x) = U_H$, the domain will be $[-\frac{L}{2}, \frac{L}{2}]$ with $-\frac{W_{well}}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{W_{well}}{2}$ the well region.
