##### Charge Transport in Semiconductors
Current is created due to the physical displacement of charge carriers(electrons and holes) in a material.
$$
\phi = \frac{\text{\# of particles}}{\text{time area}} $$
$\phi$ is the flux of particles, which is the number of particles crossing a unit area per unit time, it's dimension is $L^{-2} T^{-1}$.
If each particle has a charge $Q$, the current density $\vec{J}$ is given by:
$$ \vec{J} = \frac{\text{current}}{\text{area}} = \frac{\text{charge}}{\text{time area}} = \frac{Q \cdot \text{\# of particles}}{\text{time particles}}{\text{time area}} = Q \phi $$
Neglecting quantum phenomena(like tunneling), particles flow because of two main effects:
1. An electric field $\epsilon$ that exerts a force on the charged particles, causing them to drift.






##### Effect of an Electric Field $\epsilon$(drift of the carriers)

##### Effect due to random movement of free particles(diffusion of the carriers)
