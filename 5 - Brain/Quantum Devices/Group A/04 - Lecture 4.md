##### Charge Transport in Semiconductors
Current is created due to the physical displacement of charge carriers(electrons and holes) in a material.
$$
\phi = \frac{\text{\# of particles}}{\text{time area}} $$
$\phi$ is the flux of particles, which is the number of particles crossing a unit area per unit time, it's dimension is $L^{-2} T^{-1}$.
If each particle has a charge $Q$, the current density $\vec{J}$ is given by:
$$ \vec{J} = \frac{\text{current}}{\text{area}} = \frac{\text{charge}}{\text{time area}} = \frac{Q \cdot \text{\# of particles}}{\text{time particles}}{\text{time area}} = Q \phi $$
Neglecting quantum phenomena(like tunneling), particles flow because of two main effects:
1. An electric field $\epsilon$ that exerts a force on the charged particles, causing them to drift.
	Following the effective mass theory, at $T > 0K$, the average velocity of the carriers is zero $\langle v \rangle = 0$. The single particle is not motionless, it has a random thermal velocity $\vec{v}_{th}$, but the average velocity of all the particles is zero. If we take a cross-section we can observe the same number of particles moving in and out. When we apply an electric field, it exerts a force on the charged particles, causing them to accelerate in the direction of the field(for holes) or opposite to it(for electrons). . However, due to scattering events with impurities, phonons, and other carriers, the particles do not accelerate indefinitely(link to Sommerfeld model).  
	The average velocity is no longer zero, so we can define a drift velocity:
$$ \begin{cases}
\vec{v}_{n, drift} = - \mu_n \vec{\epsilon} \\
\vec{v}_{p, drift} = + \mu_p \vec{\epsilon}
				\end{cases} $$
	Where $\mu_n$ and $\mu_p$ are the electron and hole mobilities, which are positive quantities that characterize how easily the carriers can move through the material under the influence of an electric field. The negative sign for electrons indicates that they move opposite to the direction of the electric field, while holes move in the same direction as the field.
