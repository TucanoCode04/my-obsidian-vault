##### Non Homogeneous Devices At Equilibrium
The non homogeneity aspect implies position dependency on the carrier densities:
$$n = n(x) \quad p = p(x)$$
These dependencies explicit the presence of diffusion currents:
$$J_{n, diff} |_{eq} \neq 0 \quad J_{p, diff} |_{eq} \neq 0$$
However, the equilibrium condition, called of detailed balance, implies that the total current for both carriers SEPARATELY is zero:
$$J_n |_{eq} = 0 \quad J_p|_{eq} = 0$$
So we need drift currents that compensates separately the diffusion currents. So the detailed balance condition implies the existence of electric fields inside the device at equilibrium such that:
$$J_{n, drift} |_{eq} + J_{n, diff} |_{eq} = 0 \quad J_{p, drift} |_{eq} + J_{p, diff} |_{eq} = 0$$
