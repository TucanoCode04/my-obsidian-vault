##### Introduction to Electrical Conduction in Crystals
A crystal is a spatially periodic arrangement of identical atoms or molecules. An elemental material is made of a single type of atom normally from group IV of the periodic table, like Silicon (Si) or Germanium (Ge). A compound material is made of two or more types of atoms, normally from groups III and V, like Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) or Indium Phosphide (InP).
