##### Introduction to Electrical Conduction in Crystals
A crystal is a spatially periodic arrangement of identical atoms or molecules. An elemental material is made of a single type of atom normally from group IV of the periodic table, like Silicon (Si) or Germanium (Ge). A compound material is made of two or more types of atoms, normally from groups III and V, like Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) or Indium Phosphide (InP).
A particle with electric charge $Q$ in an electric field $\vec{E}$, the electric field could even be inside a material by applying a voltage for example, experiences a force $\vec{F}$ given by:
$$\vec{F} = Q \vec{E}$$
This force causes particles(electrons or holes) to accelerate, creating an electric current $\vec{J}$, this is the microscopic origin of electrical conduction.
The electric field tilts the potential energy landscape of the crystal, wells created by the nuclei, creating a potential gradient that causes charged particles to move.
