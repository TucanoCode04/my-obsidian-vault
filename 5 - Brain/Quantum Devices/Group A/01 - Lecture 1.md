##### Introduction to Electrical Conduction in Crystals
A crystal is a spatially periodic arrangement of identical atoms or molecules. An elemental material is made of a single type of atom normally from group IV of the periodic table, like Silicon (Si) or Germanium (Ge). A compound material is made of two or more types of atoms, normally from groups III and V, like Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) or Indium Phosphide (InP).
A particle with electric charge $Q$ in an electric field $\vec{E}$, the electric field could even be inside a material by applying a voltage for example, experiences a force $\vec{F}$ given by:
$$\vec{F} = Q \vec{E}$$
This force causes particles(electrons or holes) to accelerate, creating an electric current $\vec{J}$, this is the microscopic origin of electrical conduction.
The electric field tilts the potential energy landscape of the crystal, wells created by the nuclei, creating a potential gradient that causes charged particles to move towards lower potential energy(higher if the charge is negative like electrons). The electric field does work on the charged particles, increasing their kinetic energy and causing them to move through the crystal lattice.
##### Microscopic Ohm's Law

##### Potential Energies 
- Isolated Atom: The potential energy of an electron in an isolated atom is quantized, meaning it can only take on specific discrete and stable energy levels. From Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously, which leads to the formation of distinct energy levels. These energy levels are determined by the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nucleus, following the Coulomb potential.
