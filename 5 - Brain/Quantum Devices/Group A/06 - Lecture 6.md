##### A different way to build the equilibrium band diagram 
We separate two pieces of crystal, one p type and one n type, of the non homogeneous device(like we did before at $t<0$). 
The only energy shared at this point in the system is a free electron energy level, defined as the minimum energy required to bring a free electron outside its subsystem.

##### For example in Metals
The $q\phi_M$ is the energy required to bring an electron from the Fermi level inside the metal to the vacuum level just outside the metal surface. The only levels that are occupied are the ones below the Fermi level, inside the material, this meaning t
