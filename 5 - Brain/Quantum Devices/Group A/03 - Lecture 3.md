In order to provide a better understanding of the Fermi Energy level, we will see the graphical representation of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function.

We can first identify some asymptotes:
- For very high energy values, the probability of occupation tends to 0
- For very low energy values the probability of occupation tends to 1, meaning that all states are occupied
- At the Fermi level th
