# Phase $\theta$
A phase $\theta$ is an angle-like parameter that describes the position within a periodic cycle. 
This means that if we analyze for example a wave or an oscillation, the period will be $T = \frac{1}{f}$ where $f$ is the frequency of the wave or oscillation, that is, how many cycles occur in one second. The difference between cycles and periods is that a cycle is one complete repetition of a wave's pattern, while the period is the specific amount of time it takes to complete one cycle. 
The phase $\theta$ then indicates where we are within that period, typically measured in radians or degrees.
