1. Define divergence and curl in an electric field, derive using Stokes' theorem and Gauss's law. Define electric potential($U$) and relate it to the electric field.  Define the gauge invariance of the electric potential.
2. Define divergence and curl in a magnetic field, derive using Stokes' theorem and Gauss's law. Define magnetic vector potential($A$) and relate it to the magnetic field. Define the gauge invariance of the magnetic vector potential.
3. Relationship between momentum and vector potential  and expand the Schrödinger equation for a free electron in a electric and magnetic field. Write the effects of the gauge invariance on the wave function.
