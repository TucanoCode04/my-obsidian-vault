1. Define divergence and curl in an electric field, derive using Stokes' theorem and Gauss's law. Define electric potential($U$) and relate it to the electric field.  Define the gauge invariance of the electric potential.
2. Define divergence and curl in a magnetic field, derive using Stokes' theorem and Gauss's law. Define magnetic vector potential($A$) and relate it to the magnetic field. Define the gauge invariance of the magnetic vector potential.
3. Relationship between momentum and vector potential  and expand the Schrödinger equation for a free electron in a electric and magnetic field. Write the effects of the gauge invariance on the wave function.

4. Describe the crystal lattice and Bravais lattice(brief description of different types) with mathematical formulas. Define primitive cell, unit cell, and Wigner-Seitz cell. Ho is the crystal structure obtained from the Bravais lattice, fractional coordinates, use Silicon as an example.
5. Amorphous structures and radial distribution function(RDF), define and describe both even the graph.
6. Point defects in crystals, describe all types(even the one not in the notes but in the slides) and give examples, describe even their properties and effect. How do they change the conductivity, and how does it work. Describe color centers, f-centers, and point defects in diamond.
