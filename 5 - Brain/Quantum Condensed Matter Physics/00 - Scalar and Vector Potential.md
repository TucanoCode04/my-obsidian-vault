# Scalar and Vector Potential
##### Divergence and Curl
The divergence of a vector field $\vec{A}$  is a scalar field representing the rate of change of the vector field's magnitude in all directions in a infinitezimal volume around a point. It is defined as:
$$\nabla \cdot \vec{A} = \frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial A_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial z}$$
where $A_x$, $A_y$ and $A_z$ are the components of the vector field $\vec{A}$ in the x, y and z directions respectively.

The curl of a vector field $\vec{A}$ is another vector field representing the rotation or circulation of the vector field in all directions around a point. It is defined as:
$$\nabla \times \vec{A} = \left( \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial A_y}{\partial z} \right) \hat{i} + \left( \frac{\partial A_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x} \right) \hat{j} + \left( \frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y} \right) \hat{k}$$
where $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$ and $\hat{k}$ are the unit vectors in the x, y and z directions respectively.
It is represented in this way because, for each direction, the curl component is calculated as the difference between the rate of change of the vector field's components perpendicular to that direction. 
##### Electric Field
We can express the behavior of the electric field $\vec{F}$ using Maxwell's equations:
$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
$$\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$$
Where $\rho$ is the charge density, which is the amount of electric charge per unit volume, so the electric field is proportional to the charge density and it diverges from positive charges and converges towards negative charges.
