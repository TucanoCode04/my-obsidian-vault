# Electrons in a Periodic Potential
This model aims to describe the behavior of electrons in a crystalline solid, where the atoms are arranged in a periodic lattice structure. The periodic potential arises from the regular arrangement of positively charged atomic nuclei and the negatively charged electron cloud surrounding them. This periodic potential significantly influences the motion and energy levels of electrons within the solid.
We described the lattice using primitive vectors $\vec{a_1}, \vec{a_2}, \vec{a_3}$, which define the unit cell of the crystal. The position of each lattice point can be expressed as:
$$\vec{R_n} = n_1 \vec{a_1} + n_2 \vec{a_2} + n_3 \vec{a_3}$$
where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers that index the lattice points. The periodic potential $V(\vec{r})$ satisfies the condition:
$$V(\vec{r} + \vec{R_n}) = V(\vec{r})$$
We consider a solid with a given volume $V = L_x L_y L_z$, containing $N_{TOT} = N_1 N_2 N_3$ unit cells, where $N_i = \frac{L_i}{a_i}$ is the number of unit cells along the $i$-th direction. 
##### Schrödinger Equation in a Periodic Potential
We want to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for an electron in this periodic potential:
$$\hat{H} \psi
