# Metal Model
We want to understand the behavior of electrons in metals. A common approach is to model the electrons as a free electron gas, where they move freely within the metal lattice, only occasionally scattering off impurities or lattice vibrations (phonons). 
This model is based on two main assumptions:
1. There's no Coulomb repulsion between electrons, meaning they don't interact with each other so we can treat them as independent particles.
2. The nuclei are considered fixed in place, providing a flat and constant potential background for the electrons, meaning we ignore any potential variations caused by the lattice structure and electrons are free to move.

The electrons are kept inside the metal by an infinite potential barrier at the surface, which prevents them from escaping. This is a simplification, but it allows us to focus on the behavior of electrons within the metal. 
The metal contains a large number of
