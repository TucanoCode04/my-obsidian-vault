# Metal Model
We want to understand the behavior of electrons in metals. A common approach is to model the electrons as a free electron gas, where they move freely within the metal lattice, only occasionally scattering off impurities or lattice vibrations (phonons). 
This model is based on two main assumptions:
1. There's no Coulomb repulsion between electrons, meaning they don't interact with each other so we can treat them as independent particles.
2. The nuclei are considered fixed in place, providing a flat and constant potential background for the electrons, meaning we ignore any potential variations caused by the lattice structure and electrons are free to move.
