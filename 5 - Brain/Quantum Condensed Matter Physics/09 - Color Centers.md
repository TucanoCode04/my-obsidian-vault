# Color Centers
F-centers are defects in a crystal lattice where an anion has left its position, and an electron occupies the vacancy. These centers can absorb and emit light, making them important in various optical applications.
We can perceive the electron as trapped in a potential well created by the surrounding positive ions, this space is approximately of radius $2a$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. The energy levels of the electron in this well determine the wavelengths of light that can be absorbed or emitted.
The SchrÃ¶dinger equation for an electron in a box of width $2a$ can be solved to find the quantized energy levels(eigenvalues). So the eigenfunctions are discrete, regulated by the boundary conditions of the well, given by $L=2a$:
$$\begin{cases}
x, y,z  > 0,\quad x, y,z < 2a & y > 0, \quad y < 2a  & z > 0, \quad z < 2a \\ 
x \leq 0, \quad x \geq 2a \rightarrow V(x) = \infty \\
y \leq 0, \quad y \geq 2a \rightarrow V(y) = \infty \\
z \leq 0, \quad z \geq 2a \rightarrow V(z) = \infty
\end{cases}$$
