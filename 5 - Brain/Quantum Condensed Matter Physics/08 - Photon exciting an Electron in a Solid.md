# Photon exciting an Electron in a Solid
We consider a photon with energy $E = \hbar \nu$ incident on a solid material. The photon can interact with the electrons in the solid, potentially exciting an electron from a lower energy state to a state whose gap is equal to the photon energy. 
The electrons in the solid feel an attractive potential from the positively charged atomic nuclei, which modifies their energy levels compared to free electrons. 
$$
\vec{p} = e \cdot \vec{r}
$$
This force is called dipole force. Where $e$ is the charge of the electron and $\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the nucleus to the electron. 
Classically the dipole force causes the electron to oscillate at the frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave $\nu$.
$$\Delta V = - \vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} \quad \Rightarrow \quad V(t) = - \vec{p} \cdot \vec{E_{ph}}$$
Where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field vector of the incident wave(the photon), that oscillates in time. $\Delta V$ is the change in potential energy of the electron due to the interaction with the electric field of the photon. That give us the time-dependent classical potential $V(t)$.
In quantum mechanics, we use operators to describe physical quantities. The potential energy operator $\hat{V}(t)$ corresponding to the classical potential $V(t)$ is given by:
$$\hat{V}(t) = -e \cdot \vec{r} \cdot \vec{E_{ph}}$$
Where $\vec{E_{ph}} = \vec{E_0}(e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r} - \omega t})$
