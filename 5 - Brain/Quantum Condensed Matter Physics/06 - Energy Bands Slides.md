##### Band Structure of Aluminum
The band structure of aluminum shows that it is a metal, as there are energy bands that cross the Fermi level, allowing for free movement of electrons and electrical conductivity. The conduction band and valence band overlap, meaning there is no band gap, which is characteristic of metals. It can seem like there's a band gap from the first image, but if we change the point of view we can see that the bands actually overlap.

##### Band Structure of Silicon
We can easily see the difference between a metal and a semiconductor by comparing their band structures. In the case of silicon, we can see that there is a band gap between the valence band and the conduction band, which prevents electrons from easily moving from one band to the other. 
We can also appreciate the difference between direct and indirect band gaps. In a direct band gap, the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band occur at the same value of k, allowing for efficient electron-hole recombination and photon emission. In an indirect band gap, the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band occur at different values of k, requiring a phonon to assist in the recombination process, making it less efficient for light emission.
We can also see the degeneracy of the valence band at the $\Gamma$ point, which is due to the presence of heavy hole and light hole bands. The heavy hole band has a larger effective mass compared to the light hole band, which affects the transport properties of holes in the material.

##### Band Structures Comparison: Silicon vs Gallium Arsenide
When comparing the band structures of silicon and gallium arsenide (GaAs), we can observe several key differences that highlight their distinct electronic properties. Silicon has an indirect band gap, meaning that the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band occur at different points in k-space. This results in less efficient electron-hole recombination, making silicon less suitable for optoelectronic applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes.
