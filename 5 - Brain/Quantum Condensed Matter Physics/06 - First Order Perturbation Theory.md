# First Order Perturbation Theory
From previous lectures: $\vec{k}$ is quantum number used to label the momentum of a particle in a periodic potential. 
##### Parabolic Band Approximation
The Parabolic Band Approximation assumes that near the band edges (conduction band minimum and (conduction band maximum), the energy-momentum relationship can be approximated as
