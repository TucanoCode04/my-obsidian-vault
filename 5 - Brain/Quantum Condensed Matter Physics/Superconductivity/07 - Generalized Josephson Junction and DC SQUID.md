# Generalized Josephson Junction and DC SQUID
Again, the mechanisms that allow electric current to flow through a superconducting tunnel junction are:
- **Coherent**: Tunneling of Cooper pairs(inductive) for $i < I_c$ and $V < 2\frac{\Delta}{e}$.(Josephson Tunneling)
- **Incoherent**: Quasiparticle tunneling(resistive) for $i \geq I_c$ and $V \geq 2\frac{\Delta}{e}$.(Giaever Tunneling)
- **Capacitive**: Coupling between the two superconductor leads across the insulating barrier where $C = \epsilon \frac{wd}{2a}$. Relevant in AC regime.
In a generalized Josephson junction, all three mechanisms are considered.
