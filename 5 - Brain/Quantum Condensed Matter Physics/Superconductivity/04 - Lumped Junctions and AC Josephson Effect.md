# Lumped Junctions and AC Josephson Effect
The general form of the inductance of a Josephson junction, meaning the property that relates the voltage across the junction to the time derivative of the current through it, is given by:
- rewriting the voltage-phase relationship $V(t) = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi} \frac{d\psi}{dt}$ as $ \frac{d\psi}{dt} = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} V(t)$
- substituting this into the current-phase relationship
