# Basic Properties of Superconductors
##### Perfect Conductivity 
When the material is cooled below a critical temperature ($T_C$), its electrical resistance drops to zero. This means that an electric current can flow indefinitely without any energy loss.
The critical temperature varies for different materials, some semiconductors exhibit superconductivity at relatively high temperatures (high-$T_C$ superconductors).
Usually, very pure materials show a sharper transition to the superconducting state, compared to impure ones, because of the shorter electron mean free path in impure materials(which is related to scattering from impurities). So, the wider the transition region, the more impurities are present in the material and the lower the perfect conductivity.
The best way to experimentally observe perfect conductivity is to set up a persistent current loop in a superconducting ring and measure the decay of the current over time. In a superconductor, the current should persist indefinitely without any measurable decay.
This experiment is made by cooling a superconducting ring below its critical temperature and inducing a current in it using a switch or an external magnetic field. Once the current is established, the switch, which is also superconductive to maintain purity, is opened, and the current is monitored over time using sensitive magnetometers or other measurement techniques. 
The lower limit of resistivity ever achieved in a superconductor is on the order of $\rho< 10^{-23} \ \Omega \cdot m$, which is many orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional conductors like copper or silver.
