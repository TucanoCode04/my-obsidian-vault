# Basic Properties of Superconductors
##### Perfect Conductivity 
When the material is cooled below a critical temperature ($T_C$), its electrical resistance drops to zero. This means that an electric current can flow indefinitely without any energy loss.
The critical temperature varies for different materials, some semiconductors exhibit superconductivity at relatively high temperatures (high-$T_C$ superconductors).
Usually, very pure materials show a sharper transition to the superconducting state, compared to impure ones, because of the shorter electron mean free path in impure materials(which is related to scattering from impurities). So, the wider the transition region, the more impurities are present in the material and the lower the perfect conductivity.
The best way to experimentally observe perfect conductivity is to set up a persistent current loop in a superconducting ring and measure the decay of the current over time. In a superconductor, the current should persist indefinitely without any measurable decay.
This experiment is made by cooling a superconducting ring below its critical temperature and inducing a current in it using a switch or an external magnetic field. Once the current is established, the switch, which is also superconductive to maintain purity, is opened, and the current is monitored over time using sensitive magnetometers or other measurement techniques. 
The lower limit of resistivity ever achieved in a superconductor is on the order of $\rho< 10^{-23} \ \Omega \cdot m$, which is many orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional conductors like copper or silver.
##### Meissner Effect(Perfect Diamagnetism) 
Superconductor and perfect conductors both react to an external magnetic field by expelling it via dissipationless eddy currents at a surface layer. 
However, in a perfect conductor, if the magnetic field is applied before cooling below $T_C$, the magnetic flux remains trapped inside the material. So it will expel the magnetic field only if it is applied after cooling below $T_C$. 
In contrast, a superconductor will expel the magnetic field regardless of whether it was applied before or after cooling below $T_C$. The only limit is given by the critical magnetic field ($H_C$), above which superconductivity is destroyed, and the material reverts to its normal state.
Diamagnetism is perfect only for bulk superconductors, since the magnetic field can penetrate a thin surface layer of thickness called the London penetration depth ($\lambda$), which is typically on the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers. 
A way to experimentally observe the Meissner effect is to cool a superconducting sample below its critical temperature in the presence of an external magnetic field and then measure the magnetic susceptibility(which quantifies the degree of magnetization in magnetization in response to an applied magnetic field) of the sample. 
The Meissner effect shows that superconductors are not merely perfect conductors but exhibit a unique quantum state that expels magnetic fields.
##### Critical Magnetic Field(s) and Critical Current Density
When a system becomes superconducting, it transitions into a state of lower free energy compared to the normal state. This reduction in free energy comes from the formation of Cooper pairs and the opening of an energy gap, which lowers the internal energy (U), and from the more ordered nature of the superconducting state, which decreases the entropy (S). Since the free energy is defined as $(F = U - TS)$, both of these effects contribute to making the superconducting state energetically favorable. The difference in free energy between the normal and superconducting phases is called the **condensation energy**.
However, a superconducting material also expels magnetic fields from its interior (the Meissner effect), and doing so requires energy. If an external magnetic field is applied, the system must spend condensation energy to keep the field out. When the magnetic field strength exceeds a certain critical value $(H_C)$, the energy required to maintain this field expulsion becomes larger than the condensation energy gained from remaining superconducting. At this point, the superconducting state is no longer energetically favorable, and the material transitions back to the normal (non-superconducting) state.

In type-I superconductors, there is a single critical magnetic field $(H_C)$ above which superconductivity is completely destroyed, so the transition is abrupt. In type-II superconductors, there are two critical fields: the lower critical field $(H_{C1})$, where magnetic flux begins to penetrate the material in the form of vortices(vortex lattice), and the upper critical field $(H_{C2})$, above which superconductivity is destroyed entirely. Between these two fields, the material exists in a mixed state where both superconducting and normal regions coexist.
The phase transition in zero magnetic field is of second order, meaning that the transition occurs smoothly without latent heat. However, when a magnetic field is applied, the transition can become first order, characterized by a discontinuous change in magnetization and the release or absorption of latent heat. This is particularly evident in type-I superconductors, where the transition from the superconducting to the normal state under an applied magnetic field involves a sudden change in properties.
Since, from the thermodynamic standpoint, it exists a critical field that destroys superconductivity, it is possible to define a critical transport current density $(J_C)$, that will induce a magnetic field at the surface of the superconductor equal to the critical field $(H_C)$ destroying superconductivity. This is called Slisbee effect.
