# Basic Properties of Superconductors
##### Perfect Conductivity 
When the material is cooled below a critical temperature ($T_C$), its electrical resistance drops to zero. This means that an electric current can flow indefinitely without any energy loss.
The critical temperature varies for different materials, some semiconductors exhibit superconductivity at relatively high temperatures (high-$T_C$ superconductors).
Usually, very pure materials show a sharper transition to the superconducting state, compared to impure ones, because of the shorter electron mean free path in impure materials(which is related to scattering from impurities). So, the wider the transition region, the more impurities are present in the material and the lower the perfect conductivity.
The best way to experimentally observe perfect conductivity is to set up a persistent current loop in a superconducting ring and measure the decay of the current over time. In a superconductor, the current should persist indefinitely without any measurable decay.
This experiment is made by cooling a superconducting ring below its critical temperature and inducing a current in it using a switch or an external magnetic field. Once the current is established, the switch, which is also superconductive to maintain purity, is opened, and the current is monitored over time using sensitive magnetometers or other measurement techniques. 
The lower limit of resistivity ever achieved in a superconductor is on the order of $\rho< 10^{-23} \ \Omega \cdot m$, which is many orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional conductors like copper or silver.
##### Meissner Effect(Perfect Diamagnetism) 
Superconductor and perfect conductors both react to an external magnetic field by expelling it via dissipationless eddy currents at a surface layer. 
However, in a perfect conductor, if the magnetic field is applied before cooling below $T_C$, the magnetic flux remains trapped inside the material. So it will expel the magnetic field only if it is applied after cooling below $T_C$. 
In contrast, a superconductor will expel the magnetic field regardless of whether it was applied before or after cooling below $T_C$. The only limit is given by the critical magnetic field ($H_C$), above which superconductivity is destroyed, and the material reverts to its normal state.
Diamagnetism is perfect only for bulk superconductors, since the magnetic field can penetrate a thin surface layer of thickness called the London penetration depth ($\lambda$), which is typically on the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers. 
A way to experimentally observe the Meissner effect is to cool a superconducting sample below its critical temperature in the presence of an external magnetic field and then measure the magnetic susceptibility(which quantifies the degree of magnetization in magnetization in response to an applied magnetic field) of the sample. 
The Meissner effect shows that superconductors are not merely perfect conductors but exhibit a unique quantum state that expels magnetic fields.
##### Critical Magnetic Field(s) and Critical Current Density
The Meissner effect can be destroyed by applying a magnetic field stronger than a critical value ($H_C$), which is related to the concept of condensation energy. 
When the magnetic field exceeds $H_C$, the energy cost of maintaining the superconducting state becomes greater than the energy gained from expelling the magnetic field, leading to a transition back to the normal state. Basically the
