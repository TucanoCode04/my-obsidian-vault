# The Macroscopic Quantum Model
The London brothers, beginning from classical electrodynamics and assuming that superelectrons do not scatter, derived a partial description of the electrodynamics of superconductors. However the London equations do not account for the microscopic origins of superconductivity. 
Later, they were able to show that their equations could be derived from the Schrödinger equation by describing the superelectrons fluid with a macroscopic wave function. 
They realized that superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that manifests itself on a macroscopic scale.
This concept is similar in laser physics, where a large number of photons occupy the same quantum state, leading to coherent light emission, sharing then the same wavefunction.
The hypothesis of the Macroscopic Quantum Model is that all superelectrons in a superconductor can be described by a single macroscopic wave function $\Psi (\vec{r}, t)$, which encapsulates the collective behavior of the superelectrons.
