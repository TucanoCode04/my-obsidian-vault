# Extended Josephson Junctions
For now we have only considered lumped Josephson Junctions, where the gauge-invariant phase difference difference and the current density are uniform across the junction area. 
However, in many practical situations the junction dimensions are large enough to thread magnetic flux, leading to spatial variations of the phase difference and current density.
Extended Josephson junctions can be further divided into two categories:
- Short Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields generated by the junction currents can be neglected. They can produce interesting interference effects and can support vortices(that cause dissipation).
- Long Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields cannot be neglected, leading to nonlinear dynamics such as the spatial decay of field and currents away from vortices over characteristic length scales.
##### Short Josephson Junctions
We consider the cross-section of a Josephson junction:
- The 2 superconductors are each thicker than their London penetration depth, so that magnetic fields are expelled from the superconductors, basically avoiding border effects$$b_i >> \lambda_i$$
- The junction lateral dimensions are much larger that the thickness of the insulating barrier so that edge effects can be neglected
$$w,d >> 2a$$
- The magnetic field is applied in-plane, along the y-axis and is uniform across the junction area.
$$\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{y}$$
We want to find the gauge-invariant phase across an infinitesimal distance $\Delta z$ along the junction length (z-axis):
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a$$

We realize that the line integral of the phase along the chosen contour is identical to the one studied for the DC SQUID, since from the previous assumptions it can be seen as a SQUID loop with 2 lumped junctions connected in parallel.
We can exploit our previous results:
$$\oint_C \nabla \theta \cdot d\vec{l} = \psi_c - \psi_b + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_b^c \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l} - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_d^a \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
So, from the relation above we get:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a = - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_b^c \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l} + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_d^a \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
As always the integral over a contour of the vector potential can be converted into a surface integral of the magnetic field, which is simply the magnetic flux threading the junction area:
$$\oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} = \int_S \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{S} = \Phi$$
The line integration of the current density can be neglected since:
- when $dl || \hat{z}$, the contour is deep enough in the bulk so that any magnetic field-induced screening current is negligible and the supercurrent driving the junction is finite but oriented along $\hat{x}$, so it's perpendicular to the integration path(so the dot product is zero)
- when $dl || \hat{x}$, the two adjacent segments are very close to each other(since we are considering an infinitesimal $\Delta z$), so the supercurrent density is the same on both directions and opposite in sign, so the two integrals cancel out.
Thus we get:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a = - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \Phi$$
We an easily express the magnetic flux threading the junction area in terms of the applied magnetic field, since again from the previous assumptions the applied field is exponentially screened from the superconductors, so the effective $x$ range where the field is non-zero is limited to the barrier thickness plus the London penetration depths of the 2 superconductors:
$$h_{eff} = 2a + \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$$
Thus, the flux is:
$$\Phi = B_y \times h_{eff} \times \Delta z$$
So that:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a =  \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff} \Delta z$$
The phase changes in a certain direction only if there is a magnetic field component perpendicular to that direction.
When taking the limit $\Delta z \to 0$, we can express the spatial derivative of the phase along each direction:
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} =  \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff}$$
This result can be generalized to arbitrary magnetic field orientations:
$$\nabla \psi = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} h_{eff} (\vec{B} \times \hat{n})$$
where $\hat{n}$ is the unit vector normal to the junction plane. The normal is the direction along which the phase does not change. 
**Since I didn't understand anything I will rewrite it:**
- we are considering a small surface element of the junction area, that basically spans between z and x axis
- we are considering a magnetic field along y axis
- our supercurrent is flowing along the x axis
- we calculate the magnetic flux relative to this small surface element
- we want to calculate the phase difference between the two extremities of the surface element along z axis and x axis
- we find that the phase difference along x axis is zero, since there is no magnetic flux threading a surface element parallel to y-z plane
- we find that the phase difference along z axis is proportional to the magnetic flux threading the small surface element we are considering
- along the y axis there is no phase difference since our surface element has no extension along y axis
