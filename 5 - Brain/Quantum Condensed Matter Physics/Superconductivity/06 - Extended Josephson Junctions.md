# Extended Josephson Junctions
For now we have only considered lumped Josephson Junctions, where the gauge-invariant phase difference difference and the current density are uniform across the junction area. 
However, in many practical situations the junction dimensions are large enough to thread magnetic flux, leading to spatial variations of the phase difference and current density.
Extended Josephson junctions can be further divided into two categories:
- Short Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields generated by the junction currents can be neglected. They can produce interesting interference effects and can support vortices(that cause dissipation).
- Long Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields cannot be neglected, leading to nonlinear dynamics such as the spatial decay of field and currents away from vortices over characteristic length scales.
##### Short Josephson Junctions
We consider the cross-section of a Josephson junction:
- The 2 superconductors are each thicker than their London penetration depth, so that magnetic fields are expelled from the superconductors, basically avoiding border effects$$b_i >> \lambda_i$$
- The junction lateral dimensions are much larger that the thickness of the insulating barrier so that edge effects can be neglected
$$w,d >> 2a$$
- The magnetic field is applied in-plane, along the y-axis and is uniform across the junction area.
$$\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{y}$$
We want to find the gauge-invariant phase across an infinitesimal distance $\Delta z$ along the junction length (z-axis):
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a$$
![[Pasted image 20251117142732.png]]
We realize that the line integral of the phase along the chosen contour is identical to the one studied for the DC SQUID, since from the previous assumptions it can be seen as a SQUID loop with 2 lumped junctions connected in parallel.
We can exploit our previous results:
$$\oint_C \nabla \theta \cdot d\vec{l} = \psi_c - \psi_b + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_b^c \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l} - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_d^a \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
So, from the relation above we get:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a = - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_b^c \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l} + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_d^a \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
As always the integral over a contour of the vector potential can be converted into a surface integral of the magnetic field, which is simply the magnetic flux threading the junction area:
$$\oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} = \int_S \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{S} = \Phi$$
The line integration of the current density can be neglected since:
- when $dl || \hat{z}$, the contour is deep enough in the bulk so that any magnetic field-induced screening current is negligible and the supercurrent driving the junction is finite but oriented along $\hat{x}$, so it's perpendicular to the integration path(so the dot product is zero)
- when $dl || \hat{x}$, the two adjacent segments are very close to each other(since we are considering an infinitesimal $\Delta z$), so the supercurrent density is the same on both directions and opposite in sign, so the two integrals cancel out.
Thus we get:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a = - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \Phi$$
We an easily express the magnetic flux threading the junction area in terms of the applied magnetic field, since again from the previous assumptions the applied field is exponentially screened from the superconductors, so the effective $x$ range where the field is non-zero is limited to the barrier thickness plus the London penetration depths of the 2 superconductors:
$$h_{eff} = 2a + \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$$
Thus, the flux is:
$$\Phi = B_y \times h_{eff} \times \Delta z$$
So that:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a =  \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff} \Delta z$$
The phase changes in a certain direction only if there is a magnetic field component perpendicular to that direction.
When taking the limit $\Delta z \to 0$, we can express the spatial derivative of the phase along each direction:
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} =  \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff}$$
This result can be generalized to arbitrary magnetic field orientations:
$$\nabla \psi = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} h_{eff} (\vec{B} \times \hat{n})$$
where $\hat{n}$ is the unit vector normal to the junction plane. The normal is the direction along which the phase does not change. 


**Since I didn't understand anything I will rewrite it:**
**1. The Josephson phase difference**
The gauge-invariant phase across the junction barrier is:$$
\varphi(y,z) = \theta_2(y,z) - \theta_1(y,z) - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_{\text{across}x} A_x\,dx$$
- The phase is defined **between** the two superconductors
- It is a function of **y and z** (junction dimensions).
- It does **not** depend on x →
$$\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x} = 0$$**2. Why phase can vary along y and z**
Magnetic fields can thread surfaces spanned by **x–y** and **x–z**.
- A magnetic field component **perpendicular** to a direction causes phase variation **along** that direction.
- Therefore:
    - $B_y$​ → phase gradient along **z**
    - $B_z$​ → phase gradient along **y**
**3. Relation between magnetic flux and phase**
Use **Stokes’ theorem**:
$$\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf A \cdot d\mathbf l = \iint_S (\nabla\times\mathbf A)\cdot dS = \iint_S \mathbf B \cdot dS = \Phi$$
Then the Josephson relation:
$$\Delta\varphi = -\frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \oint A\cdot dl$$
Therefore:
$$\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial l} = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \frac{d\Phi}{dl}$$
**4. Magnetic flux through the effective thickness**
Magnetic fields are strongly screened by the superconductors (Meissner effect).
Thus the field survives only in:
- the barrier (thickness = $2a$)
- thin penetration layers inside each electrode ($\lambda_1, \lambda_2$​)
Define the **effective thickness**:
$$h_{\text{eff}} = \lambda_1 + 2a + \lambda_2$$
Flux through a small strip of width $\Delta z$:
$$\Phi = B_y\, h_{\text{eff}}\, \Delta z$$
**5. Phase gradients generated by magnetic fields**
From the flux–phase relation:
**(a) Magnetic field along y**
Flux threads an x–z surface → phase varies along **z**:
$$\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial z} = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y\, h_{\text{eff}}$$
**(b) Magnetic field along z**
Flux threads an x–y surface → phase varies along **y**:
$$\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial y} = -\frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_z\, h_{\text{eff}}$$
(Conventional sign choice.)
**6. Why no phase gradient along x**
- The Josephson phase is **defined across x**, not inside the junction.
- Inside each superconductor $\theta(x) = \text{constant}$.
- So:
    $$\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x} = 0$$
**Ulterior recap:**
1. **The Josephson phase only changes when there is a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction along which we evaluate the phase.**  
    This follows from Stokes’ theorem: the magnetic flux through a surface determines the phase gradient along the boundary.
2. **The phase does not depend on the x direction**, because along x we only define the _phase difference_ between the two superconductors.  
    Inside each superconductor the phase is constant, so
    $$\partial\varphi/\partial x = 0$$
3. **We apply a magnetic field along the y axis**, i.e.$$\mathbf B = B_y \hat y$$
4. **In the bulk of the superconductors, the magnetic field is expelled (Meissner effect)**.  
    The field only penetrates:
    - the insulating barrier (thickness 2a)
    - thin layers in each superconductor (thickness ≈ penetration depth $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$
    giving an effective magnetic thickness
    $$h_{\text{eff}} = \lambda_1 + 2a + \lambda_2$$
5. **Along the y direction, the applied field does _not_ change the phase**, because $B_y$​ is _parallel_ to y.  
    The magnetic field must be _perpendicular_ to the direction for which you compute the phase gradient, so
    $$B_y \perp z \quad \Rightarrow \quad \partial\varphi/\partial z \neq 0,$$$$B_y \parallel y \quad \Rightarrow \quad \partial\varphi/\partial y = 0.$$
6. **Along the z direction, the field _is_ perpendicular**, so it creates a phase gradient.  
    The flux through a small surface element of area $h_{\text{eff}}\, \Delta z$ is
    $$\Phi = B_y \, h_{\text{eff}}\, \Delta z$$
    Using the Josephson phase–flux relation:
    $$\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial z} = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y \, h_{\text{eff}}.$$

**Back to the original text:**

Since we assumed that $\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{y}$, the only non-zero phase gradient is along the z direction, since in the y direction as we found the phase does not change because there is no magnetic field component perpendicular to it.
Thus the phase variation across the junction length is:
$$\psi = \psi(z)$$
By integrating the phase gradient along z we can find the phase difference at any point z along the junction length:
$$int_0^z \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} dz= \int_0^z \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff} dz$$
$$ \Rightarrow \psi(z) = \psi(0) + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff} z$$
where $\psi(0)$ is the phase difference at z=0, it's a constant phase which we cannot measure directly.
If we insert this is the current-phase relation:
$$J_s(\vec{r},t) = J_s(y,z,t) = J_c(y,z) \sin(\psi(z,t))$$
There's no x dependence since we are considering a uniform junction along that direction.
The total supercurrent flowing through the junction is obtained by integrating the current density over the junction area:
$$i = \int_{-w/2}^{w/2} \int_{-d/2}^{d/2} J_c(y,z) \sin(\psi(z,t)) dy dz$$
If we assume that the critical current density is uniform across the junction area:
$$i = I_c \frac{\sin \left( \pi \frac{\Phi_J}{\Phi_0} \right)}{\pi \frac{\Phi_J}{\Phi_0}} \sin(\psi(0,t))$$
where:
$$\Phi_J = B_y h_{eff} d$$ is the magnetic flux threading the short Josephson junction area.
$$I_c = J_c w d$$ is the maximum supercurrent that can flow through the junction when no magnetic field is applied.

Now let's look at the maximum supercurrent that can flow through the junction, this occurs when $\sin(\psi(0,t)) = \pm 1$:
$$i_{max}= I_c \left| \frac{\sin \left( \pi \frac{\Phi_J}{\Phi_0} \right)}{\pi \frac{\Phi_J}{\Phi_0}} \right|$$
This result shows that the maximum supercurrent that can flow through a short Josephson junction in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field follows a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, similar to the one observed in a DC SQUID.
![[Pasted image 20251118142734.png]]
It shows a central lobe with maximum supercurrent at zero magnetic flux, followed by a series of smaller lobes with alternating signs, corresponding to the zeros of the sine function in the numerator. 
On the y-axis we have the normalized maximum supercurrent, that is basically the critical current of the junction in the absence of magnetic field, while on the x-axis we have the magnetic flux threading the junction area normalized to the flux quantum.

From a mathematical standpoint the single-junction interference pattern is analogous tot the single-slit diffraction pattern in optics.
Similarly the pattern of a SQUID is analogous to the double-slit diffraction pattern, since in that case we have 2 junctions in parallel instead of one.
![[Pasted image 20251118143333.png]]
We took the graph from before and overlaid the SQUID interference pattern for comparison, which shows narrower lobes and higher sensitivity to magnetic flux changes around zero flux.

The analogy stems from the fact that in both the magnetic flux through a Josephson junction and the light passing through a slit change the phase of a wavefunction, leading to interference effects when integrating over a spatially varying phase.

##### Relation Magnetic Flux to Phase
We now analyze different influences on the relation between magnetic flux and phase in an extended Josephson junction.

**Case 1: No External Flux:**
As we can see from the previous derivation, if no external magnetic flux($\Phi_J = 0$) threads the junction area, the phase difference is uniform across the junction:
$$\psi(z) = \psi(0) + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff} z = \psi(0) + 2\pi \frac{\Phi_J}{\Phi_0} \frac{z}{d} = \psi(0)$$
![[Pasted image 20251118183825.png]]
This means the current density is uniform across the junction area:
$$J_s(z,t) = J_c \sin(\psi(z,t)) = J_c \sin(\psi(0,t))$$
![[Pasted image 20251118183904.png]]
As shown in the image, the applied magnetic field is uniform, so that no magnetic flux threads the junction area, leading to a uniform phase difference and current density across the junction, represented by the vertical lines.
Thus the total supercurrent flowing through the junction is simply:
$$i = \int_{-w/2}^{w/2} \int_{-d/2}^{d/2} J_c \sin(\psi(0,t)) dy dz = J_c w d \sin(\psi(0,t)) = I_c \sin(\psi(0,t))$$
where $I_c$ is the critical current of the junction in the absence of magnetic field.
Where:
- $\psi(0) = \frac{\pi}{2}$ gives the maximum supercurrent $i_{max} = I_c$
- $\psi(0) \neq \frac{\pi}{2}$ gives a lower supercurrent $i < I_c$
![[Pasted image 20251118183811.png]]
This basically resembles the lumped Josephson junction case, since in the lumped case the phase difference is uniform across the junction since we assume no magnetic flux threading the junction area.

**Case 2: Flux increased to $\Phi_0/2$:**
When the magnetic flux threading the junction area is increased to half a flux quantum($\Phi_J = \Phi_0/2$), the phase difference varies linearly from $\psi(0)$ at z=0 to $\psi(0) + \pi$ at z=d:
$$\psi(z) = \psi(0) + 2\pi \frac{\Phi_J}{\Phi_0} \frac{z}{d} = \psi(0) + \pi \frac{z}{d}$$
![[Pasted image 20251118184338.png]]
So that in total the difference across the junction length is $\pi$.
This means the current density varies sinusoidally across the junction area, going from $J_c \sin(\psi(0,t))$ at z=0 to $J_c \sin(\psi(0,t) + \pi) = - J_c \sin(\psi(0,t))$ at z=d:
$$J_s(z,t) = J_c \sin(\psi(z,t)) = J_c \sin\left(\psi(0,t) + \pi \frac{z}{d}\right)$$
![[Pasted image 20251118184451.png]]
As shown in the image, the applied magnetic field is uniform, so that a magnetic flux of half a flux quantum threads the junction area, leading to a linearly varying phase difference and sinusoidally varying current density across the junction, represented by the vertical lines with a maximum at the center and minima at the edges.
The total supercurrent decreases accordingly to the interference pattern derived before, since if I integrate the sinusoidal current density over the junction area I get a lower total supercurrent.
![[Pasted image 20251118184723.png]]

**Case 3: Flux increased to $\Phi_0$:**
When the magnetic flux threading the junction area is increased to one flux quantum($\Phi_J = \Phi_0$), the phase difference varies linearly from $\psi(0)$ at z=0 to $\psi(0) + 2\pi$ at z=d:
$$\psi(z) = \psi(0) + 2\pi \frac{\Phi_J}{\Phi_0} \frac{z}{d} = \psi(0) + 2\pi \frac{z}{d}$$
![[Pasted image 20251118184846.png]]
So that in total the difference across the junction length is $2\pi$.
This means the current density varies sinusoidally across the junction area, going from $J_c \sin(\psi(0,t))$ at z=0 to $J_c \sin(\psi(0,t) + 2\pi) = J_c \sin(\psi(0,t))$ at z=d:
$$J_s(z,t) = J_c \sin(\psi(z,t)) = J_c \sin\left(\psi(0,t) + 2\pi \frac{z}{d}\right)$$
![[Pasted image 20251118184923.png]]
As shown in the image, the applied magnetic field is uniform, so that a magnetic flux of one flux quantum threads the junction area, leading to a linearly varying phase difference and sinusoidally varying current density across the junction, represented by two sets of vertical lines with minima in the center and at the edges and a maximum in between. The two sets of lines differ in direction meaning that the current density changes sign at the center of the junction.
The total supercurrent goes to zero accordingly to the interference pattern derived before, since I will have the same amount of positive and negative current density contributions when integrating over the junction area.
![[Pasted image 20251118185631.png]]

**Case 4: Flux increased to $3\Phi_0/2$:**
When the magnetic flux threading the junction area is increased to one and a half flux quantum($\Phi_J = 3\Phi_0/2$), the phase difference varies linearly from $\psi(0)$ at z=0 to $\psi(0) + 3\pi$ at z=d:
$$\psi(z) = \psi(0) + 2\pi \frac{\Phi_J}{\Phi_0} \frac{z}{d} = \psi(0) + 3\pi \frac{z}{d}$$
![[Pasted image 20251118185705.png]]
So that in total the difference across the junction length is $3\pi$.
This means the current density varies sinusoidally across the junction area, going from $J_c \sin(\psi(0,t))$ at z=0 to $J_c \sin(\psi(0,t) + 3\pi) = - J_c \sin(\psi(0,t))$ at z=d:
$$J_s(z,t) = J_c \sin(\psi(z,t)) = J_c \sin\left(\psi(0,t) + 3\pi \frac{z}{d}\right)$$
![[Pasted image 20251118185740.png]]
As shown in the image, the applied magnetic field is uniform, so that a magnetic flux of one and a half flux quantum threads the junction area, leading to a linearly varying phase difference and sinusoidally varying current density across the junction, represented by three sets of vertical lines with maxima at the edges and center and minima in between. The three sets of lines differ in direction meaning that the current density changes sign twice across the junction length.
The total supercurrent increases again accordingly to the interference pattern derived before, since when integrating over the junction area we have 2 positive current density contributions and one negative, leading to a net positive supercurrent.
