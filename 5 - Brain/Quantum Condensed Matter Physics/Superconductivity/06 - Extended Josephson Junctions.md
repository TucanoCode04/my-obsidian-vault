# Extended Josephson Junctions
For now we have only considered lumped Josephson Junctions, where the gauge-invariant phase difference difference and the current density are uniform across the junction area. 
However, in many practical situations the junction dimensions are large enough to thread magnetic flux, leading to spatial variations of the phase difference and current density.
Extended Josephson junctions can be further divided into two categories:
- Short Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields generated by the junction currents can be neglected. They can produce interesting interference effects and can support vortices(that cause dissipation).
- Long Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields cannot be neglected, leading to nonlinear dynamics such as the spatial decay of field and currents away from vortices over characteristic length scales.
##### Short Josephson Junctions
We consider the cross-section of a Josephson junction:
- The 2 superconductors are each thicker than their London penetration depth, so that magnetic fields are expelled from the superconductors, basically avoiding border effects$$b_i >> \lambda_i$$
- The junction lateral dimensions are much larger that the thickness of the insulating barrier so that edge effects can be neglected
$$w,d >> 2a$$
- The magnetic field is applied in-plane, along the y-axis and is uniform across the junction area.
$$\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{y}$$
We want to find the gauge-invariant phase across an infinitesimal distance $\Delta z$ along the junction length (z-axis):
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a$$

We realize that the line integral of the phase along the chosen contour is identical to the one studied for the DC SQUID, since from the previous assumptions it can be seen as a SQUID loop with 2 lumped junctions connected in parallel.
We can exploit our previous results:
$$\oint_C \nabla \theta \cdot d\vec{l} = \psi_c - \psi_b + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_b^c \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l} - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_d^a \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
So, from the relation above we get:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a = - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_b^c \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l} + \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_d^a \Lambda \vec{J_s} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
As always the integral over a contour of the vector potential can be converted into a surface integral of the magnetic field, which is simply the magnetic flux threading the junction area:
$$\oint_C \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} = \int_S \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{S} = \Phi$$
The line integration of the current density can be neglected since:
- when $dl || \hat{z}$, the contour is deep enough in the bulk so that any magnetic field-induced screening current is negligible and the supercurrent driving the junction is finite but oriented along $\hat{x}$, so it's perpendicular to the integration path(so the dot product is zero)
- when $dl || \hat{x}$, the two adjacent segments are very close to each other(since we are considering an infinitesimal $\Delta z$), so the supercurrent density is the same on both directions and opposite in sign, so the two integrals cancel out.
Thus we get:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a = - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \Phi$$
We an easily express the magnetic flux threading the junction area in terms of the applied magnetic field, since again from the previous assumptions the applied field is exponentially screened from the superconductors, so the effective $x$ range where the field is non-zero is limited to the barrier thickness plus the London penetration depths of the 2 superconductors:
$$h_{eff} = 2a + \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$$
Thus, the flux is:
$$\Phi = B_y \times h_{eff} \times \Delta z$$
So that:
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a =  \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff} \Delta z$$
The phase changes in a certain direction only if there is a magnetic field component perpendicular to that direction.
When taking the limit $\Delta z \to 0$, we can express the spatial derivative of the phase along each direction:
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} =  \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y h_{eff}$$
This result can be generalized to arbitrary magnetic field orientations:
$$\nabla \psi = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} h_{eff} (\vec{B} \times \hat{n})$$
where $\hat{n}$ is the unit vector normal to the junction plane. The normal is the direction along which the phase does not change. 


**Since I didn't understand anything I will rewrite it:**
**1. The Josephson phase difference**
The gauge-invariant phase across the junction barrier is:$$
\varphi(y,z) = \theta_2(y,z) - \theta_1(y,z) - \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \int_{\text{across}x} A_x\,dx$$
- The phase is defined **between** the two superconductors
- It is a function of **y and z** (junction dimensions).
- It does **not** depend on x →
$$\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x} = 0$$**2. Why phase can vary along y and z**
Magnetic fields can thread surfaces spanned by **x–y** and **x–z**.
- A magnetic field component **perpendicular** to a direction causes phase variation **along** that direction.
- Therefore:
    - $B_y$​ → phase gradient along **z**
    - $B_z$​ → phase gradient along **y**
**3. Relation between magnetic flux and phase**
Use **Stokes’ theorem**:
$$\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf A \cdot d\mathbf l = \iint_S (\nabla\times\mathbf A)\cdot dS = \iint_S \mathbf B \cdot dS = \Phi$$
Then the Josephson relation:
$$\Delta\varphi = -\frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \oint A\cdot dl$$
Therefore:
$$\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial l} = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} \frac{d\Phi}{dl}$$
**4. Magnetic flux through the effective thickness**
Magnetic fields are strongly screened by the superconductors (Meissner effect).
Thus the field survives only in:
- the barrier (thickness = $2a$)
- thin penetration layers inside each electrode ($\lambda_1, \lambda_2$​)
Define the **effective thickness**:
$$h_{\text{eff}} = \lambda_1 + 2a + \lambda_2$$
Flux through a small strip of width $\Delta z$:
$$\Phi = B_y\, h_{\text{eff}}\, \Delta z$$
**5. Phase gradients generated by magnetic fields**
From the flux–phase relation:
**(a) Magnetic field along y**
Flux threads an x–z surface → phase varies along **z**:
$$\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial z} = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y\, h_{\text{eff}}$$
**(b) Magnetic field along z**
Flux threads an x–y surface → phase varies along **y**:
$$\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial y} = -\frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_z\, h_{\text{eff}}$$
(Conventional sign choice.)
**6. Why no phase gradient along x**
- The Josephson phase is **defined across x**, not inside the junction.
- Inside each superconductor $\theta(x) = \text{constant}$.
- So:
    $$\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x} = 0$$
**Ulterior recap:**
1. **The Josephson phase only changes when there is a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction along which we evaluate the phase.**  
    This follows from Stokes’ theorem: the magnetic flux through a surface determines the phase gradient along the boundary.
2. **The phase does not depend on the x direction**, because along x we only define the _phase difference_ between the two superconductors.  
    Inside each superconductor the phase is constant, so
    $$\partial\varphi/\partial x = 0$$
3. **We apply a magnetic field along the y axis**, i.e.$$\mathbf B = B_y \hat y$$
4. **In the bulk of the superconductors, the magnetic field is expelled (Meissner effect)**.  
    The field only penetrates:
    - the insulating barrier (thickness 2a)
    - thin layers in each superconductor (thickness ≈ penetration depth $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$
    giving an effective magnetic thickness
    $$h_{\text{eff}} = \lambda_1 + 2a + \lambda_2$$
5. **Along the y direction, the applied field does _not_ change the phase**, because $B_y$​ is _parallel_ to y.  
    The magnetic field must be _perpendicular_ to the direction for which you compute the phase gradient, so
    $$B_y \perp z \quad \Rightarrow \quad \partial\varphi/\partial z \neq 0,$$$$B_y \parallel y \quad \Rightarrow \quad \partial\varphi/\partial y = 0.By​∥y⇒∂φ/∂y=0.
6. **Along the z direction, the field _is_ perpendicular**, so it creates a phase gradient.  
    The flux through a small surface element of area heff Δzh_{\text{eff}}\, \Delta zheff​Δz is
    
    Φ=By heff Δz.\Phi = B_y \, h_{\text{eff}}\, \Delta z.Φ=By​heff​Δz.
    
    Using the Josephson phase–flux relation:
    
    ∂φ∂z=2πΦ0By heff.\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial z} = \frac{2\pi}{\Phi_0} B_y \, h_{\text{eff}}.∂z∂φ​=Φ0​2π​By​heff​.

# ✔ **One-sentence summary**

Because the magnetic field is applied along y, and the Josephson phase changes only when the field is perpendicular to the direction of variation, we get **no phase gradient in y** and **a finite phase gradient in z**, proportional to the flux penetrating the effective magnetic thickness of the junction.

If you want, I can also produce a **visual ASCII diagram** showing the directions x–y–z, current, phase, and where the flux enters.

**Back to the original text:**

Since we assumed that $\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{y}$, the only non-zero phase gradient is along the z direction, since in the y direction as we found the phase does not change because there is no magnetic field component perpendicular to it.
