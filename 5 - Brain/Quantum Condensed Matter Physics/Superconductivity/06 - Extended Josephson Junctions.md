# Extended Josephson Junctions
For now we have only considered lumped Josephson Junctions, where the gauge-invariant phase difference difference and the current density are uniform across the junction area. 
However, in many practical situations the junction dimensions are large enough to thread magnetic flux, leading to spatial variations of the phase difference and current density.
Extended Josephson junctions can be further divided into two categories:
- Short Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields generated by the junction currents can be neglected. They can produce interesting interference effects and can support vortices(that cause dissipation).
- Long Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields cannot be neglected, leading to nonlinear dynamics such as the spatial decay of field and currents away from vortices over characteristic length scales.
##### Short Josephson Junctions
We consider the cross-section of a Josephson junction:
- The 2 superconductors are each thicker than their London penetration depth, so that magnetic fields are expelled from the superconductors $$b_i >> \lambda_i$$
- The junction lateral dimensions are much larger that the thickness of the insulating barrier so that edge effects can be neglected
$$w,d >> 2a$$
- The magnetic field is applied in-plane, along the y-axis and is uniform across the junction area.
$$\vec{B} = B_0 \hat{y}$$
We want to find the gauge-invariant phase across an infinitesimal distance $\Delta z$ along the junction length (z-axis):
$$\psi_c - \psi_b = \psi_d - \psi_a$$

We realize that the line integral of the phase along the chosen contour is identical to the one studied for the DC SQUID, since
