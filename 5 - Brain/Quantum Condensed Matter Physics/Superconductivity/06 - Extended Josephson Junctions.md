# Extended Josephson Junctions
For now we have only considered lumped Josephson Junctions, where the gauge-invariant phase difference difference and the current density are uniform across the junction area. 
However, in many practical situations the junction dimensions are large enough to thread magnetic flux, leading to spatial variations of the phase difference and current density.
Extended Josephson junctions can be further divided into two categories:
- Short Josephson junctions, where the self-induced magnetic fields generated by the junction currents can be neglected.
