# Fluxoid Quantization
Fluxoid quantization requires a full quantum mechanical treatment of the superconducting state. 
If we consider the supercurrent of a homogeneous(so that the density of Cooper pairs $n_s$ is constant) isotropic(the effective mass of Cooper pairs $m^*$ is a scalar, and not a tensor since in each direction the effective mass is the same) superconductor, then the supercurrent density $\mathbf{J}_s$ is given by:
$$\Lambda \vec{J}_s =
