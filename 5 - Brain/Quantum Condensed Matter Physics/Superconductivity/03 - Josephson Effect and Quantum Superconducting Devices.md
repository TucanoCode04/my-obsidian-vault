# Josephson Effect and Quantum Superconducting Devices
Tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where particles pass through a potential barrier that they classically shouldn't be able to cross. This is due to the wave-like nature of of particles, allowing them to have a non-zero probability of being found on the other side of the barrier.
For normal electrons, tunneling can occur in tunneling junctions, where two conductors are separated by a thin insulating barrier. Classically tunnel junctions have infinite impedance at zero frequency, but quantum mechanically, if the barrier is thin enough, electrons can tunnel through it, allowing a small DC(direct current) to cross the junction(It is possible even for AC(alternating current) to cross the junction due to tunneling, but the DC case is more straightforward to understand).
We now first want to analyze a junction made of one conductor, the insulator and a superconductor. 
##### S-I-N(Superconductor-Insulator-Normal metal) Junction
In a S-I-N junction, the superconductor has a gap in its density of states around the Fermi level, while the normal metal has a continuous density of states. When a voltage is applied across the junction, electrons from the normal metal can tunnel into the superconductor only if they have enough energy to overcome the superconducting gap. This results in a characteristic I-V curve with a threshold voltage corresponding to the superconducting gap.
More specifically Cooper-pairs in the superconductor cannot tunnel into the normal metal as single electrons, they need to break up into two single electrons, each having energy at least equal to the superconducting gap Δ.
