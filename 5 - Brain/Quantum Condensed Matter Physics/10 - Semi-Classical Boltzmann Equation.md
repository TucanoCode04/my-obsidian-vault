# Semi-Classical Boltzmann Equation
The semi-classical Boltzmann equation is a fundamental equation in statistical mechanics that combines the classical position and momentum of particles with quantum mechanical principles. It is used to describe the statistical behavior of a thermodynamic system out of equilibrium.
If we imagine the Fermi sphere in momentum space, where each point inside the sphere represents an occupied quantum state by an electron. Their occupation is described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, which gives the probability of occupation of each state at a given temperature.
$$f_0(\vec{k}, T) = \frac{1}{e^{\frac{E(\vec{k}) - \mu}{k_B T}} + 1}$$ where $
