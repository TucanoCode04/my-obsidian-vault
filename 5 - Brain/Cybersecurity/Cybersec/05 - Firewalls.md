# Firewalls
A firewall is used to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic between a network with an higher security level(trusted) and a network with a lower security level(untrusted), based on a set of security rules.
It implements compartmentalization, meaning that it separates different network segments to limit the spread of potential threats.
- Ingress firewalls: control incoming traffic, used to select the services that can be accessed from outside the network.
